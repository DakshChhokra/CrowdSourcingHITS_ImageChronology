      <strong>Instructions: </strong>
      Given three images, identify the correct order of tasks for each image
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three images of traffic here. They were initially correctly sequenced but now have been jumbled.
      Each image has been arbitrarily labeled as A, B, and C
      Identify the correct order that the images were taken in by analyzing the movement of vehicles and put them in the
      blanks below. 
      
      For instance if the chronological order of images was such that Image B was taken first, followed by Image A and finally 
      followed by Image C, you would put B in the first blank, A in the second blank and C in the third blank.

    <!-- Your image file URLs will be substituted for the "image_url" variable below 
          when you publish a batch with a CSV input file containing multiple image file URLs.
          To preview the element with an example image, try setting the src attribute to
          "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cv-demo-images/basketball-outdoor.jpg" -->
